# ProjectTwo
Knightly Collectbiles

# Description
A Pokemon website directed towards collectors and fans of the franchise that allows the user to track,
add, and delete Pokemon cards to and from their collection. The Pokemon APIs grab information about the 
cards and have links to where the cards can be purchased as well as the UI being accessible and easy to
add or delete cards from the users' collection. The back end allows the user to create an account for the
website which allows for a personalized Pokemon card collection as well as authentication for entering the website once the user has created an account.
